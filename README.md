# Chicago Crime Visualization

## Overview

The main aim of this visualization was to allow users to see the crime metrics from 2015 to 2022. The dataset comes directly from the City of Chicagoâ€™s website, spanning from the year 2015 to 2022. The main aim of creating this visualization using Tableau was to analysis the different parameters such as the location, arrest %, seasons, time of day that would affect the crime count in the city and turn this in valuable and actionable insights. The initial data transformations were carried out in Tableau.This visualization has 6 dashboards which gives a in-depth understanding about the crimes that have occurred based on the different parameters. 

## Dashboard 1
The opening dashboard gives an overview about the crime metrics - crime count, crime rate and the arrest % for a particular year. This dashboard also gives a sneak peek into the dangerous location, and the block where the crime occurred along with the count.
